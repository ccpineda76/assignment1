    Bears are dog-like carnivores, and are very widespread, appearing in a variety of habitats
    throughout the Northern Hemisphere.  They are eight feet long and weigh more than a thousand 
    pounds.  Bears contain nonretractable claws, short tails, and a great sense of smell.
    Bears can live up to 25 years in the wild.
