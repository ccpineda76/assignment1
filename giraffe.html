  <p>
    Giraffes are long-necked mammals of Africa, with very long legs and a coat
    pattern of brown patches. They are the tallest of all land animals, and are
    very common in grasslands of East Africa. These animals grow to almost their
    full height by four years of age but gain weight until they are seven or
    eight. Their tails can be quite long, up to a meter in length. They enjoy
    eating leaves especially from acacia trees.
